We hold these truths to be self-evident: DevStart is awesome. If we were to
choose the most awesome things from an incredibly awesome list of awesome
things then we would certainly hold DevStart to be the most awesome. If I were
a fish that lacked the ability to speak I would still try to find a way to
say that DevStart is awesome. Why wouldn't I? It's SO awesome.
