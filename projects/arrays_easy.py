#Here's your first line of code
notes = ["do","re","mi","fa","so","la","ti","do"]



# Project Description:
#   Say the notes of the scale up and down
#   You can do it once the manual way, but then do it with a loop or two :)

### Clue: What happens when you type `len(notes)` in the Python Console? What about `range(1,10)`? What about `range(10,1)`? What about `range(10,1,-1)`?
### Expected output:
# do
# re
# me
# fa
# so
# la
# ti
# do
# do
# ti
# la
# so
# fa
# me
# re
# do
