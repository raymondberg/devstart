    <h4>Individual Projects</h4>
    <p> There are lots of projects you can work on! You can make one of the projects out of the Arduino book, or make a python text-based game, or make a simple graphical Python game (with some help from a coach), or a program that will generate music or art!</p>
    <p> Before you get started, we have to make sure that we know how much work will be involved. This is called project planning! It makes sure you have a clear idea of what you want to build before you start so you don't get distracted while you work. It also lets you break the project up into solveable projects because you know what the whole size will be. Take a look at the project template below and use it as a guide to make your own. Don't worry too much about copying it, just use it to get started.</p>

      <pre>Idea: Make a python game that plays a little like Pac Man, but with lots of little dots zinging around that you have to avoid.

How it will work:
  You steer the character around with the arrow keys.
  When the character gets on top of a pellet it eats it and the score goes up.
  As the score goes up, more enemy dots show up and start to zing around.
  If the character gets hit with a dot he dies and has to start over again.

Small Things I need to do:
 Design the main character
 Design the enemy dots
 Design the pellets
 Figure out how to make a screen pop up with the game in it
 Write the logic to make the character move
 Write the logic to make the character do things when it hits dots or pellets
 Write the logic to generate darts
